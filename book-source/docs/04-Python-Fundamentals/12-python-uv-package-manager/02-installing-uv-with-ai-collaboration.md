# Installing UV with AI Collaboration

## What We're About to Do

You already understand **why** UV matters (from Lesson 1). Now let's get it installed on your computer.

Installation takes under 1 minute: you run one command, verify it worked, and you're done. Simple, deterministic tasks like this don't need AI—you just follow the direct instructions for your platform.

**Where AI becomes valuable:** When something goes wrong. If you encounter errors, AI can diagnose platform-specific issues and suggest fixes.

**In this lesson, you will:**
1. Run the installation command for your platform (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
2. Verify the installation worked
3. Understand what PATH is and why it matters
4. Learn when to use AI (troubleshooting) vs. direct commands (simple tasks)

Let's get started. You'll be done in under 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Install UV (Direct Command)

Pick your platform and run the command. That's it.

### macOS or Linux

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads the official UV installation script from Astral
- Executes it to install UV to `~/.local/bin/` (both macOS and Linux)
- Automatically adds UV to your PATH so you can use the `uv` command

**Time:** ~30 seconds

### Windows (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads the official UV installation script from Astral
- Executes it to install UV to `C:\Users\YourName\.local\bin`
- Automatically adds UV to your PATH
- **Important:** Restart PowerShell after installation

**Time:** ~30 seconds + PowerShell restart

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Close your terminal completely and open a new one. Then run:

```bash
uv --version
```

**Expected output:**
```
uv 0.9.9
```

If you see a version number, UV is installed correctly. You're done! Skip to the "When to Use AI" section below.

### What If You See "command not found"?

If you see:
```
uv: command not found
```

**This means your PATH isn't configured yet.** Now is when AI becomes useful.

Jump to the "Troubleshooting with AI" section below.

## Understanding PATH (2-Minute Explanation)

**PATH** is your computer's "registry" of command locations. When you type `uv --version`, your computer:
1. Looks through directories listed in PATH
2. Finds the `uv` executable
3. Runs it

**Without PATH configured:**
```
uv: command not found  ← Computer can't find UV
```

**With PATH configured:**
```
uv 0.9.9  ← Computer found UV and ran it
```

The installation script automatically adds UV's directory to your PATH. That's why you can type `uv` from anywhere and it works.

**Why this matters:** If something goes wrong during installation, understanding PATH helps you troubleshoot (with AI's help).

## When to Use AI: The Key Principle

This lesson demonstrates an important pattern:

**Simple, deterministic tasks (like installation):**
- ✅ Use direct commands
- ✅ Follow platform-specific instructions
- ✅ Takes under 1 minute

**Complex, ambiguous problems (like troubleshooting):**
- ✅ Use AI to diagnose platform-specific issues
- ✅ Get context-aware fixes
- ✅ Learn WHY something broke

**Don't use AI for everything.** Use it strategically when it adds value.

## Troubleshooting with AI

If you encountered errors during installation, **now** is when AI becomes valuable. Here are common scenarios:

### Error 1: "command not found" After Installation

**Open your AI CLI tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT) and ask:**

```
After installing UV, I'm getting "uv: command not found".
I'm using [WINDOWS/MAC/LINUX].
How do I fix this?
```

AI will diagnose:
- Whether you need to restart your shell
- Whether PATH was configured correctly
- Platform-specific PATH configuration commands

### Error 2: Permission Denied

**Ask your AI:**

```
I'm getting "Permission Denied" when trying to install UV.
I'm using [WINDOWS/MAC/LINUX].
What should I do?
```

AI will suggest:
- Using `sudo` (macOS/Linux) if needed
- Checking antivirus settings (Windows)
- Alternative installation methods

### Error 3: Network Issues

**Ask your AI:**

```
I'm getting a network error when installing UV.
Error: [paste exact error message]
What should I do?
```

AI will help:
- Diagnose connection issues
- Suggest alternative download methods
- Check if Astral's servers are down

## What You Just Learned

**The core pattern:**
- ✅ Simple tasks (installation): Use direct commands
- ✅ Complex problems (troubleshooting): Use AI for diagnosis
- ✅ Don't over-engineer simple processes with AI
- ✅ PATH makes commands available system-wide

**Key insight:** AI-driven development doesn't mean "use AI for everything." It means using AI strategically when it adds value—troubleshooting, debugging, understanding complex systems—not for simple, deterministic tasks that take 30 seconds.

This pattern will continue throughout the chapter:
- **Creating projects**: Direct command (`uv init`)
- **Adding dependencies**: Direct command (`uv add package-name`)
- **Understanding why something failed**: AI collaboration
- **Debugging complex dependency conflicts**: AI collaboration

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion (ChatGPT, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) for these exercises.

### Prompt 1: Understand PATH Deeply

```
I just installed UV and it updated my PATH. Explain PATH in simple terms—what is it, why does it matter, and what would happen if UV wasn't added to PATH? Use an analogy I can relate to.
```

**Expected outcome:** Clear understanding of PATH without needing technical background.

### Prompt 2: Troubleshoot "command not found"

```
I installed UV but I'm getting "uv: command not found" when I run `uv --version`. I'm using [YOUR OS]. Walk me through diagnosing and fixing this issue step by step.
```

**Expected outcome:** Concrete troubleshooting steps tailored to your platform.

### Prompt 3: When to Use AI vs. Direct Commands

```
This lesson says "don't use AI for everything." Help me understand: when should I use AI for package management tasks, and when should I just run commands directly? Give me 3 examples of each.
```

**Expected outcome:** Strategic understanding of when AI adds value vs. when it's overhead.

### Prompt 4: Installation Security Review

```
I ran this installation command: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

Is this safe? What risks exist when running installation scripts from the internet? How can I verify this is the official UV installer?
```

**Expected outcome:** Understanding of installation security practices and how to verify sources.
